  **Development**
  
At first a second branch for only the angular application was created.
The branch was originaly planned to have only the HTML and CSS before their transforation.
However, the application was made in the same folder(branch), for easier development.
You can see the time it took for creating the application in the branch folder. I will not be deleting it.
I hope you like the site.

**Running**

In order to run the application you have to download the files and open both the server and fan-arts-app folder in seperate terminals. 
Install the npm modules in both folders by running the command 'npm i';
Then for the server type the command 'npm start' and for the angular folder type the command 'ng serve'. If an error occurs open the app folder and run the command there.
This hole process may take a few seconds or even a minute, so please wait a bit if it isn't starting the second you type these commands.
Then you will be able to access the application.
The server will create a folder called fan-arts in your Mongo DB.
